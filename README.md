# Data_cleaning_and_manipulation


## Project Description

This Data_cleaning_and_manipulation project is all about learning how to clean a dataset and improve the data where possible. 


## Summary

The main question I tried to answer was 'How can the data for this particular column be improved to make better assumptions?' For me the following parts of the data set were most important and that's why I focused on those: 

- Column names: making sure it's clear what's inside the column and optimize the column titles
- Columns with almost 100% NULL values: These columns are not of any value for me and are removed
- 'Sex' Column: Very interested in understanding if men or women are more likely to be attacked by sharks
- 'Type' Column: For the persons that are attacked, what type of incident was it? 'Type' was an unclear Column title for me
- 'Year' Column: Shark attacks were also documented many years ago. I'm especially interested to see when the attacks happened in categories of 50 years


## Dataset

For this project I used the GSAF5.csv dataset, where lots of information can be found about shark attacks: country, year, gender and many more. 


## Workflow

The dataset is very messy and inconsistent, and should be cleaned before proper evaluations can be made. I thoroughly checked the values in various columns to see if anything can be improved and made changes accordingly. 


## Organization

My repository consists of 3 files:

- data-wranging.ipynb: this is the Jupyter Notebook file with all the cleaning and manipulation
- GSAF5.csv dataset: the original dataset before any cleaning and manipulation
- README file
